                            V1.0



OBTIAN
======================

Currently there is no distribution for falbot.

To obtain falbot pull from the Git repository.  Use the following command:
git clone http://git.falconpl.org/falbot.git

FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY
========================

falbot is an IRC chat bot.  It is meant to sit on a channel, log the traffic,
and provide two other services:
    1. Provide links to the falconpl.org website by scanning the channel for the
       '!help' command.  The primary purpose of this feature is for knowledgeable
       falcon chat user to give help to new falcon users on the chat channel.
    2. Code compiler.  falbot scans the channel for keywords denoting code
       submissions for falbot to compile and send output back to the channel
       
So falbot has a narrow set of functionality for a narrow purpose.  However it
can be easily modified for other purposes you may have.  Additionally it is a
good tool to study how falcon scripting is used.

FALCONBOT MINIMAL OPERATION
========================

falbot is written in the Falcon script language and as such you will need a copy
of falcon to run falbot.  Falcon can be obtained at www.falconpl.org

falbot is configured to run on the falconpl.org webserver.  All its defaults
are set for this environment.  You can change this behavior by either changing
the code or using the command line options  (recommended option).

Default settings:
1. irc: irc.freenode.net
2. channel: #falcon
3. port: 6667
4. Logfile directory: Current working directory where the application is
   launched
5. nick: FalconBot
6. filter: nicks to ignore for compiler: Itself, CIA-nn, freenode-connect,
   ChanServ
7. !help paths: 
   A. Web site (*.ftd): '/home/pnema/dev/falcon/falcon-website/live/data'
   B. Core (*.html): '/web/falcon.com/html/core'
   C. Module (*.html): '/web/falcon.com/html/feathers'
8. Compiler is turned off, logging and !help is turned on

To launch falbot you will need to set:
--web /path/to/ftd
--core /path/to/core
--module /path/to/module

I.E.
falbot --web /path/to/ftd --core /path/to/core --module /path/to/module


COMPILER
=============

When this option is turned on, falbot will scan for key words to denote start
and stop recording a code block for a specific nick.  Key words are
{%code%}
{%codeend%} - Note actual keyword pattern allows for space and caps e.g.
  {% CodeEND  %} is valid
everything in between these two key words will be feed into a compiler and
executed.  Results will be send back to the channel

Other key words:
{%showcode%} display code in the buffer for the specific nick

{%reset%} Clear the code in the buffer for the specific nick

{%help%} Send to the specific nick compiler usage

Security: Script commands that touch the file system or execute processes have
been turned off.  See safe.fal for all falcon functions calls that have been
overridden.

HELP
=============

Display a link on the channel to the specific web page on the requested topic.

To utilize:

!help keyword must start on the first character of the message. Help options:

!help help - send usage to the nick requesting help on !help

Currently falbot support three domains for help:
1. The falconpl.org website.  These comprise the *.ftd files
2. Core: These comprise the *.html files created by faldoc
3. Module: These comprise the *.html files created by faldoc
Assumption made by falbot is each of the above categories are in flat
directories.

To access help from these categories:
!help help category (e.g. !help help web, !help help core and !help help module)
The above will send all the subjects to the specific nick.

To request a link to a subject type !help core subject.  E.g. !help core String
or !help module Compiler or !help web about.  Upon this request falbot will
address the requesting nick.  To have falbot address a different nick use:
!help-nick category subject
